# Financial-Risk-Analysis-Credit-Default-Prediction

##Introduction
This project focuses on building an advanced Credit Scoring and Default Prediction System using machine learning techniques. The goal is to evaluate the creditworthiness of customers and predict the likelihood of loan defaults, which is crucial for financial institutions in making informed lending decisions. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing customer information and credit history, this project aims to develop a robust predictive model for credit risk assessment.

##Data Overview
The dataset used in this project comprises various features related to customers' demographics, income, employment status, credit score, outstanding debts & balance, loan amount, and loan term. These features provide valuable insights into the financial behavior of customers, making it an ideal dataset for credit scoring analysis. 

##Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, involving handling missing values, cleaning the data to remove duplicates and outliers, and standardizing the data for uniformity. Data quality and integrity were ensured through thorough preprocessing steps, laying the foundation for accurate model training.

Feature engineering played a pivotal role in enhancing the model's predictive power. New features were derived from existing ones, including debt-to-income ratio and interaction features capturing complex relationships between variables. These engineered features provided the model with richer information for credit risk assessment.

Explored more advanced feature engineering techniques to create new features from existing ones like:
* Interaction Features: Combine two or more features to capture complex relationships.
* Polynomial Features: Create polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.

##Model Selection & Model Training and Evaluation
Employed advanced machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, and implemented hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance. The selection of appropriate machine learning algorithms was critical. After thorough evaluation, ensemble methods such as Random Forest were chosen for their ability to handle complex relationships in the data. The ensemble approach, combined with hyperparameter tuning, ensured the model's robustness and predictive accuracy. 

Implemented k-fold cross-validation and ensemble methods to enhance model robustness and accuracy. The models were trained using the preprocessed dataset, and hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize performance. Cross-validation techniques were employed to validate the models, ensuring their ability to generalize to unseen data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC were utilized to assess the models' effectiveness in predicting loan defaults.

Performed hyperparameter tuning for the machine learning model using techniques like grid search & random search. Tune parameters such as the number of trees in the Random Forest, maximum depth of trees, and minimum samples per leaf to find the best combination for your specific dataset. Implemented anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns that might indicate fraudulent activities or errors in the dataset. Unsupervised learning algorithms like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM can be used for this purpose.

The Random Forest model was trained with 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%. The model achieved the following metrics:

* Accuracy: 85%
* Precision: 82%
* Recall: 79%
* F1-Score: 80%
* AUC-ROC: 0.92

##Conclusion
The model demonstrated robust performance in identifying potential defaults. It showcased a balanced accuracy, ensuring reliable predictions for both default and non-default cases. Visualizations indicated strong predictive features, empowering institutions with actionable insights for credit risk management.

This project showcases the power of data-driven decision-making in the realm of credit scoring. The robust model, coupled with insightful features, equips financial institutions with a reliable tool for assessing credit risk, thereby facilitating responsible lending practices. In conclusion, this project successfully built a Credit Scoring and Default Prediction System capable of evaluating customers' creditworthiness and predicting loan defaults accurately. The project's outcomes have significant implications for financial institutions, enabling them to make more informed lending decisions and mitigate potential risks effectively.
